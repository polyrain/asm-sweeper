# ASM-Sweeper

This started as an attempt to make Minesweeper in Assembler for macOS. What ended up being created was a small library for macOS assembly so you can begin understanding how Assembly works on this platform. Main.asm includes an entirely documented library on the most common building blocks you will need to begin your own command line apps, all in assembly. A small picture of this library in action:

Watch how this whole project came about and understand the sheer pain of why this won "Most Masochistic" in the UQCS Hackathon 2020 :)

Any questions let me know as an issue on this repo, but hopefully this is a useful resource for those wanting to see how macOS NASM assembler looks like/works :)
